Here's a newerfile than newfile which I just added to Tori's vision project.
Of course, to make it interesting, I've added it the 'vision/develop' branch
which I added to her repo earlier today.  Of course, I didn't tell her about
it at the time.  Still, she said she wanted to be able to play with branches
and merging.  This file plus a 'develop' branch specific change to 'newfile'
should help her do that.  And that should be more than enough justification!
